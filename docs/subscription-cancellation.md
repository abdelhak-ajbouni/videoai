# Subscription Management System

## Overview

The subscription management system handles both subscription cancellations and plan changes. Users can cancel their subscriptions while retaining all credits they've already earned, and change plans with automatic deactivation of the old subscription.

## How It Works

### 1. Subscription Cancellation

When a user cancels their subscription:

1. **Stripe Integration**: The subscription is updated in Stripe with `cancel_at_period_end: true`
2. **Database Update**: The local database is updated to reflect the cancellation status
3. **Credit Retention**: All existing credits remain available to the user
4. **No New Credits**: The user won't receive new monthly credits after the current billing period ends

### 2. Plan Changes

When a user changes their subscription plan:

1. **Old Subscription Deactivation**: All existing active subscriptions are marked as canceled
2. **New Subscription Creation**: A new subscription is created for the selected plan
3. **Immediate Credit Grant**: User receives the new plan's monthly credits immediately
4. **Seamless Transition**: No interruption in service during the plan change

### 3. User Experience

- **Immediate Access**: Users can continue using their existing credits immediately
- **Clear Communication**: The UI clearly shows the subscription status and end date
- **Reactivation Option**: Users can reactivate their subscription before the period ends
- **No Surprises**: Clear messaging about what happens to their credits
- **Easy Plan Changes**: Simple upgrade/downgrade process with automatic handling

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Backend Functions

**Cancellation:**
- `cancelSubscriptionAtPeriodEnd`: Updates subscription to cancel at period end
- `reactivateSubscription`: Removes cancellation flag and reactivates subscription

**Plan Changes:**
- `changeSubscriptionPlan`: Deactivates old subscription and creates new one
- `getCurrentSubscription`: Gets current subscription with cancellation details

#### Frontend Components

- **SubscriptionPlans.tsx**: Enhanced with cancellation, reactivation, and plan change buttons
- **BillingDashboard.tsx**: Shows subscription status and notices
- **Clear messaging**: Users understand what happens during changes

### 5. Credit Retention Policy

**Key Principles:**
- Users keep ALL credits they've already earned
- Credits never expire (unless specified by plan)
- No refunds are processed - credits remain available
- Users can continue using the platform with existing credits

**Example Scenarios:**

**Cancellation:**
- User has 500 credits from their Pro subscription
- User cancels subscription on day 15 of billing cycle
- User keeps all 500 credits and can use them
- No new credits are added on the next billing date
- User can reactivate anytime before the period ends

**Plan Change:**
- User has 200 credits from Starter plan
- User upgrades to Pro plan (500 credits)
- Old Starter subscription is deactivated
- New Pro subscription is created
- User immediately receives 500 Pro credits
- Total credits: 200 (existing) + 500 (new) = 700 credits

### 6. Database Schema

The subscription table tracks:
- `cancelAtPeriodEnd`: Boolean flag indicating cancellation status
- `currentPeriodEnd`: When the current billing period ends
- `status`: Active/canceled status
- `monthlyCredits`: Credits allocated for the current period

### 7. Stripe Integration

- Uses Stripe's `cancel_at_period_end` feature for cancellations
- Creates new subscriptions for plan changes
- Webhooks handle subscription updates
- Customer portal integration for advanced billing management
- No immediate cancellation - respects billing periods

## Benefits

1. **User-Friendly**: No loss of paid credits
2. **Transparent**: Clear communication about what happens
3. **Flexible**: Easy reactivation and plan changes
4. **Compliant**: Follows standard SaaS subscription practices
5. **Retention**: Encourages users to return by preserving their investment
6. **Seamless**: Smooth plan changes without service interruption
